# The Global Upvote

> Top voted stories across the web, summarized and updated every sixty seconds.

This was a two-week side project where I wanted to design and code a progressive web app that brought me up to speed with current events.

### UX Goal

A user can stay up-to-date on the top news from across the web without community distractions.

### Visual Goal

The appearance will only bring in web-based elements as needed and emulate a physical newspaper as much as possible.

### Development Goal

The user will benefit from all that a progressive web app provides, such as a fast perceptual speed index and offline viewing.

## Browser Plugins

The Global Upvote Tab is a browser plugin for both [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/global-upvote-tab/nbbannbnjlkkhobfdpijealmagpfbioh) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/global-upvote-tab/). This makes every new tab in your browser load The Global Upvote, but still have instant control of your url bar for navigation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
